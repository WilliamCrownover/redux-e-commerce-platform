# E-Commerce Platform, Redux Refactor

## Description

The goal of this project was to refactor the global state of the application from Reactâ€™s context API to using Redux. While the context API is a more modern approach to managing complex state, Redux is more common for now so it was good practice to understand how to convert an app between the two. After thoroughly reading through the docs on Redux, I was able to create a store for initial state and resolvers and provide this context to each component. The app functions the same way as before acting as a virtual store for a customer that includes implementing the Stripe payment platform for checkout.
